**MySQL Cars Database Analysis**

**Overview:**
This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about cars. The dataset was downloaded as a CSV file from the internet and imported into a MySQL database using MySQL Workbench 2.0. The analysis uses SQL queries to extract relevant information and answer specific questions about the dataset.

**Dataset Import:**
- Downloaded a pre-existing CSV file containing car data.
- Created a MySQL database named 'cars.'
- Used MySQL Workbench 2.0 to import the CSV file into a table within the 'cars' database.

**Business Related Questions:**
1. Read cars data.
2. Total cars.
3. Cars available in 2023.
4. Cars available in specific years (2020, 2021, 2022).
5. Total cars grouped by year.
6. Diesel cars in 2020.
7. Petrol cars in 2020.
8. Fuel cars count across years.
9. Years with more than 100 cars.
10. Years with less than 50 cars.
11. Cars count between 2015 and 2023.
12. Cars details between 2015 and 2023.

**Conclusion:**
This project demonstrates the practical application of SQL queries for data analysis in a MySQL database. By addressing specific questions, such as counting cars for different years, filtering by fuel type, and handling complex conditions, valuable insights are gained. The use of SQL commands, including SELECT, COUNT(), WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and AS, showcases the versatility of SQL for data manipulation and extraction. Overall, this analysis provides a foundation for decision-making and strategic planning based on the insights derived from the dataset.
